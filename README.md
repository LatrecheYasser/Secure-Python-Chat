# Secure-Python-Chat
Secure Client server chat  by RC4 and RSA 

This project is a simple example to how make a secure chat app using two methods of ecrypting the messages <br/>
in this project i used RC4 and RSA<br/>.
 - RSA is an asymmetric Algorithm, but it gives a very long output.
 - RC4 is a symmetric Algorithm <br/>
 i used the two of them her. by using RSA to encrypt RC4 key and send it to the other client. and use that RC4 key for the encryptiong of the messages. 
 ## Explanation 
 this is a diagram that explain how this program works
